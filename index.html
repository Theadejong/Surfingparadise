            <h1 class='mainTitle'>Surfers Paradise</h1>
            <p  class='intro'>You are a surfer who is practising for the most important surf competition of it’s life. 
                In order to prepare, you went accidentally to far away from the shore and got surprised by a group of sharks. 
                Now you  need to return to the shore as soon as possible before eaten alive by the sharks. Besides your skills, the only 
                other way to survive is to collect as many Hawaiian flowers as possible along the ride. You believe the Hawaiian flowers have 
                super powers (superstition). 
            </p>
            <p  class="instructions">
                Use your keypad ↕ to collect the Hawaiian flowers & avoid the sharks! 
                
                <br><br>You've 3 lives. 
                <br>Everytime you get bitten by the shark, you loose 1 life. 
                <br>For each 10 Hawaiian flowers you collect, you receive 1 extra life.
