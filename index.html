                John got lost while surfing with his mates and needs to return home safely. The only way for John to get back home is to ride out the wave 
                and avoid any sharks who would love to take a tasty bite out of John. Avoid the sharks and along the way collect as many Hawaiian Super Power Flowers 
                as possible.

                <br>
                Use your keypad ↕ & ↔ to help John surfing and collect as many Hawaiian flowers as possible along the ride.
